Atari 2600 Emulator

Note: This project is mainly to help with my understanding of the Atari 2600.  If you are looking for a good Atari 2600 emulator, then Stella is a much better choice.

Otherwise, my goal with this project to help me understand the requirements for programming the Atari 2600.  I feel that by writing an emulator for this platform it will greatly enhance my understanding of what is required to program for this platform.
